TODO:

-generate more interesting test images
    -check lecture slides on generating interesting test images
    -make test images with noise in them
    -update script to 
        -make them
        -run the tests on them
        -calculate volume of them
-ask Professor Reeves for help with more complex images
    -transitioning from synthetic to real images
    -intelligent picking of kernel size?
-use the analseg script to figure out how to make v3d images from vx 3d frames
    -simple pair of commands 
-make vits 3d so that a threshold can be picked intelligently
    -then pass this threshold value into the segment script
-update the volume calculation to take into account the voxel size
    -like steve said, different amount of voxels shouldnt affect volume
-VMEDIAN!
