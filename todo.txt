TODO:

-Cleanup code

-Test adaptive segmentation (with good results)
    -./adaptive_segment.sh ../ct_clip3 4 2000 ../out_ct_clip3
    -update script to 
        -make them
        -run the tests on them
        -calculate volume of them

-intelligent picking of kernel size?

-update the volume calculation to take into account the voxel size
    -like steve said, different amount of voxels shouldnt affect volume

-use the analseg script to figure out how to make v3d images from vx 3d frames
    -simple pair of commands
