This folder contains all the necessary programs and scripts to perform 3d image segmentation and noise removal, as well as calculating the volume of the resulting 3d object. 

With the end goal being volume calculation of interpolated lung nodules, after interpolation, segmentation can be achieved by calling the adaptive_segment.sh script as such:
    ./adaptive_segment.sh [in_image] [kernel_size] [num_bins] [out_image]
    Ex: ./adaptive_segment.sh ../ct_clip3 4 2000 ../out_ct_clip3
This is followed by calling the vd3vol program to get the calculated volume as such:
    ./v3dvol if=[input_file]
    Ex: ./v3dvol if=$DIRECTORY/out_test2_sphere.vx

Programs
========

segment.sh
* shell script to segment and perform noise removal on input 3d image with a user defined threshold
* works on byte images

test_segment.sh
* shell script to generate simple byte test images, and run the segment script on the tests
* also performs volume calculation on the output images from the segment script

test_segment_abstract.sh
* shell script to use existing test images in a folder, and perform segmentation & volume calculations on them using the developed utilities
* used to perform tests and gather results for the abstract report

adaptive_segment.sh
* shell script to segment and perform noise removal on input 3d image with an adaptive threshold
* works on 'short' images

v3dvol.c [v3dvol]
* VisionX program to perform volume calculation of a 3d image
* volume calculation must be performed on a binary image (0 & 255)
* voxels with values of 255 are included in volume calculation

vits_short.c [vits_short]
* VisionX program to perform iterative thresholding of a 3d image
* input parameter 'b' specifies the number of bins to use for the interative thresholding
* must be used with 'short' images
* any pixel in the image with a value greater than the max bin is placed in the max bin.

cleanup.sh
* simple shell script to quickly remove temporary files

========
Directories
========

test_segmentation
* directory to hold test images
* also contains output images from running segment.sh

abstract_images
* directory to hold images used for analysis in our abstract report
* contains test images, and output images (prefixed with out_) resulting from running test_segment_abstract.sh
